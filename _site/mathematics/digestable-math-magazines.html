        <p><em>L</em>ets get things straight. I hate lists. There’s so many lists on the Internet that I when I see another one, I blow my top. Don’t get me wrong. Lists are really good at organizing information. But it’s in bad taste. That’s why I promised myself I won’t write another list until their was a good reason for it. This qualifies.</p>

<p>Mathematical magazines are really hard to find. I could find precious few online. In a way that’s understandable. Mathematics sure is not popular. And it sure won’t sell half as fast as say a list titled ‘Lady Gaga’s Top 10 Tattoos’. But I don’t intend to write click baits that seem to be the dominant lifeforms on the Internet. It’s a matter of principle.</p>

<p>##CRUX Mathematicorum</p>

<p>Brought out by the Canadian Mathematical CRUX magazine is a long running mathematical problem solving magazine. The articles are culled from national and international math competitions. More importantly they bring you questions from lesser known competitions like the one I have open before me – The Swedish Junior Mathematics Competition. The questions range from high school level to a quite challenging level. They maintain an excellent website <a href="https://cms.math.ca/crux">here</a>. They also provide a couple of years, old magazines free as downloadable PDF files. The magazines rarely have much article content except for a monthly book review.</p>

<p>##Plus Magazine</p>

<p><a href="https://plus.maths.org">Plus magazine</a> is an online magazine which I can only describe as Popular Science meets mathematics. It started life as a part of the Millennium Mathematics Project and is supported by Cambridge University. If I was allowed to say only one thing, I’d say the magazine has credibility. Each article is written by experts in their chosen fields. The breadth of content expressed is quite extensive. They also bring out podcasts. I think everyone should read Plus. Plus helped me realize how big the mathematical world really is. I’d definitely vote this as a must read for anybody.</p>

<p>##American Mathematical Monthly</p>

<p>AMM was fist published in 1894 by the American Mathematical Society. The magazine is widely read and has an impressive track record. They focus on clear exposition and content that is widely accessible above all else. You can freely download selected articles from the magazine for free at the <a href="http://www.maa.org/press/periodicals/american-mathematical-monthly/jstor-all-stars-emthe-american-mathematical-monthlyem">JSTOR All-Star</a> project. According to JSTOR, the American Mathematical Monthly is the most widely read mathematical journal in the world. Definitely worth a shot.</p>

<p>##Pi in the Sky</p>

<p>There are actually two magazines with the name Pi in the Sky, both published by the Pacific Institute of Mathematics. One of these days I’ll have to ring them up and ask them why there are two magazines with the same name and the same general audience. The better one is hosted at the University of Alberta <a href="https://www.math.ualberta.ca/pi/">here</a>. Each month they do a series of articles on a similar issues plus interviews and book reviews. The good thing is that the magazine is freely downloadable. Meanwhile the other Pi in the sky is hosted at the Pacific Insitute for the Mathematical Science <a href="http://www.pims.math.ca/resources/publications/pi-sky">here</a>. This version of Pi in the Sky is meant for high school children, I think because their content is very simple although they do manage to have some interesting articles from time to time. They are also freely available for download.</p>

<p>##Afterthought</p>

<p>That should keep you occupied for a couple of days. They give me a lot of new ideas. I have pointedly ignored blogs on mathematics because at the end of the day they’re just blogs – not professional publications. They just don’t have the weight of authority behind them that these magazines have. I’ll be enabling  comments here because I’d like more people to suggest new material so that I can add them above.</p>
